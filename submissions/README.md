# Submissions Folder

This folder is where you should place all the CSV files received from students.

## How to use:

1. **Collect CSV files from students** via email or file sharing
2. **Save all CSV files in this folder**
3. **Run the combine script**: `python combine_csvs.py`
4. **Analyze the combined data** in the generated `combined_evaluations.csv`

## File naming suggestion:
- `evaluation_4240150_2024-12-06.csv` (student ID + date)
- `student_name_evaluation.csv`
- Or any naming convention that works for you

## Example files:
- evaluation_4240150_2024-12-06.csv
- evaluation_4240151_2024-12-06.csv
- evaluation_4240152_2024-12-06.csv

The combine script will automatically process all `.csv` files in this folder.
